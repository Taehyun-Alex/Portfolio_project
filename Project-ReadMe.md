This project is about building my portfolio.

In Web Technology class, we learned about how to build a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
We have implemented those skills into Phase-1 to Phase-5.

From the skills that we've learned, we are now building our own website where we can deploy our portfolio, including our details and projects.
